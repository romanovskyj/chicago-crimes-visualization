# Chicago Crimes Visualization

## Design
Initially I reviewed all columns of the CSV file and tried to understand, what can be interesting in this data. After review, I have decided to focus on total cases per year, categories of cases and "was the person arrested". I used Tableau public utility in order to create first version of charts and explore some outcomes. As I am going to compare such categories as years I decided to use bar chart.
