# Chicago Crimes Visualization

## Summary
This chart presents chicago crimes statistic from 2012 to 2017. When you load the project you can explore that even total number of crimes is not decreased last years, there is definitily decrease for the cases with arrests. It means that there are less heavy crimes from year to year and it is positive trend for sure.

There is the second chart where you can explore each crime type numbers in detail.

## Design
Initially I reviewed all columns of the CSV file and tried to understand, what can be interesting in this data. After review, I have decided to focus on total cases per year, categories of cases and "was the person arrested". I used Tableau public utility in order to create first version of charts and explore some outcomes. As I am going to compare such categories as years I decided to use bar chart.

I also explored that 2014 year has smallest values for all pariculary choosen crime types. The isse is that file contains some cases that do not belong to any crime types.
